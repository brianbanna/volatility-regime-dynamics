# Data Sources

This folder will hold references and data files.

Planned sources:

* NASDAQ Historical Dataset (Kaggle) – daily OHLCV data for NASDAQ-listed stocks (1990s–2020).  
* Yahoo Finance via yfinance – used to validate or extend time coverage if needed.  
* Market-Level Aggregation – derived series for market returns, rolling volatility, and trading volume.
